# Undernutrition Global Overview and Policy Recommendations

## Overview

This repository hosts a Streamlit-based application focused on providing a global overview of undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and policy recommendations. It leverages interactive visualizations and data models to present key insights on undernutrition statistics worldwide, along with evidence-based policy suggestions for addressing these challenges.

The app aims to help stakeholders, policymakers, and health organizations understand global nutrition issues and engage with data-driven recommendations for improving nutrition and public health.

## Features

- **Global Undernutrition Overview**: Visualize undernutrition data across the globe, with a focus on regions and countries most affected by malnutrition.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Dynamic charts, maps, and graphs for exploring global nutrition patterns and trends.
- **Nutrition Modeling**: Insights into nutrition modeling methods, illustrating how interventions might affect nutrition outcomes.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Evidence-based suggestions for public health interventions, focusing on cost-effectiveness and sustainability.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Required libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `altair`
  - `pandas`
  - `geopandas`
  - `pydeck`
  - `numpy`

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/undernutrition-overview.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd undernutrition-overview
```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will launch the app in your browser, allowing you to interact with the data and visualizations.

## Methodology

The app is based on the following key methodologies:

Global Undernutrition Overview:
The app retrieves undernutrition statistics from various data sources (e.g., WHO, World Bank) and visualizes them on a world map.
Data is updated periodically (if real-time data is accessible).
Nutrition Modeling:
Uses statistical models and evidence-based research to simulate the impact of nutrition interventions (e.g., food fortification, nutritional education programs) on public health.
The modeling helps to identify the most cost-effective interventions for reducing malnutrition.
##  Policy Recommendations:
Based on the evidence and modeling, the app generates actionable policy recommendations for addressing malnutrition and undernutrition.
These recommendations are designed to be practical, scalable, and adaptable to different regions and contexts.
Policy Development Process

Logistics: Policy development involves gathering data, engaging stakeholders, and collaborating across multiple sectors (health, agriculture, education).
Methodology: The app follows a data-driven approach to identify key nutrition issues, design interventions, and assess their impact through modeling.
Implementation: Policies are rolled out in phases, with continuous monitoring and evaluation to ensure effectiveness and adjust strategies as needed.
Sustainability: Policies are designed to be adaptable and sustainable in the face of changing global challenges, such as climate change and food security.
## Disclaimer

This application provides a visual representation of undernutrition statistics globally. Please note that the data used in this app is for demonstration purposes only and may not represent real-time or fully accurate data. The app is designed for educational and illustrative purposes and may have limitations due to data availability or the nature of the data source. Always refer to official organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) or the World Bank for authoritative and up-to-date information.
